==================================================================
We construct the curves and maps from page 126.
==================================================================

The curve C has genus 3
The quotient curve C/σ has genus 1
It contains a non-singular point
It is birational to the Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 154*x^2 + 6125*x 
over Rational Field
Computing alternative equations for the map C/σ -> E
Phi descends to C/σ

==================================================================
We perform the computations from Proposition 4.18.
==================================================================

psi ⚬ pi is only undefined for (0,0) and points (s,t) with Phi(s,t) = 1.
The Mordell-Weil group of E/Q is given by [ (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 0 : 1) ]
The points of E(Q) lift to (affine) C(L) only if L contain Q(sqrt{-91}).

==================================================================
We perform the computations from Proposition 4.19.
==================================================================

We have a full-rank subgroup of E(L)

==================================================================
We perform the computations from Proposition 4.20.
==================================================================

Performing elliptic curve Chabauty
The points in E(L) with rational image under Φ_E are { (0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0)
}

==================================================================
We perform the computations from Proposition 4.23.
